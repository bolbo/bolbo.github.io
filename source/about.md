# About me

Hi, I'm a french PHP developper living near Paris. 

I started working with frameworks in 2008, with Zend Framework 1. 
I started learning Symfony2 with Propel 1 as ORM at the end of 2013 and 
started unit test with [atoum](http://www.atoum.org) in january 2015. 
 
My plans for 2015 are to keep improving my knowledge with Symfony2 and atoum, start learning 
 Behat and BackboneJs and learning best practices to make beautiful code.
