# Welcome to my new blog

In this blog, I will try to log my experiments on web develoment, atoum, Behat, Backbone or Pomm.  

In the next weeks, I intend to install an Elasticsearch/Logstash/Kibana stack to store application logs for my Symfony2 apps. 
I want to try to make beautiful frontend with BackboneJS to work with a Symfony2 Rest backend, unit tested with atoum 
and functional with Behat. 

I will try to replace Propel1 Orm on my projects by [Pomm](http://www.pomm-project.org/)

2015 will be an interesting year!
